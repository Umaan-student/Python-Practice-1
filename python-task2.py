# # ================================
# # 🧠 PYTHON REVISION – PART 1 TASKS ONLY
# # Topics: print(), variables, data types, operators, input/output
# # ================================

# # 🔹 TASK 1:
# # Print your full name, age, and city — all in one print() statement but each on a new line.
# print("my name is Umaan \n i living in parbhani"  )


# # --------------------------------

# # 🔹 TASK 2:
# # Create 4 variables:
# # name (string), age (integer), height (float), and student (boolean)
# # Then print all of them with labels like:

# name = (input("your name: "))# # Name: Amaan
# # Age: 20
# # Height: 5.8
# # Student: True
# age = int(input("your age: "))
# height = float(input("your height: "))
# # student = bool(input("are you student say 1 0r 0: "))
# student = bool(int(input("input")))

# print("your name is ", name)
# print("your age is ", age)
# print("your height is ", height)
# print("student:", student)


# # --------------------------------

# # 🔹 TASK 3:
# # Take two numbers as input from the user and:
# # - Print their sum
# # - Print their difference
# # - Print their product
# # - Print their division


# # --------------------------------

# # 🔹 TASK 4:
# # Write a program that swaps the values of two variables.
# # Example: x = 10, y = 20 → After swapping → x = 20, y = 10


# # --------------------------------

# # 🔹 TASK 5:
# # Explain with print statements (in your own words):
# # What is the difference between int, float, and str in Python?


# # --------------------------------

# # 🔹 TASK 6 (Mini logic):
# # Let a = 5, b = "5"
# # Predict what will happen for each line (write comment first, then run):
# # 1. print(a + int(b))
# # 2. print(str(a) + b)
# # 3. print(a == b)
# # 4. print(a == int(b))
